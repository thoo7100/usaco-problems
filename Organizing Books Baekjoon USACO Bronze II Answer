problem
There are N empty boxes lined up in a row, and you want to put M books into the boxes. The boxes are numbered 1 to N, and the books are numbered 1 to M. Here is how to put the books into the boxes. First, you are in front of box 1, holding book 1 in your hand.

If the current book does not fit in the current box, go to 3. Otherwise, go to 2.
Put the current book in the current box. Take the next book and go to number 1.
Now move the current box to the other side and seal it with tape so it can't be opened. Bring the next box forward and go to step 1.
The capacity of box i is A i , and the size of book j is B j . A book can be put into a box if the sum of the sizes of the book and the books in the box does not exceed the capacity of the box.

Write a program that calculates the sum of the wasted capacity of the entire box when the books are placed in the above manner. The wasted capacity of a box is the box capacity minus the sum of the sizes of the books in the box.

The order of boxes and books given as input must not be changed.

input
The first line contains the number of boxes N and the number of books M. The second line contains the capacities of the boxes A 1 , A 2 , ..., A N , and the third line contains B 1 , B 2 , ..., B M .

output of power
The first line prints the sum of the wasted capacity of the entire box.

limits
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 50
1 ≤ A i , B j ≤ 1,000
